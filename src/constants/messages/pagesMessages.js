  defaultMessage: 'The Delta loyalty programme is called SkyMiles and the airline refers to its loyalty points as “Miles”.  You earn Miles when you fly with Delta or its partner airlines, use a Delta SkyMiles branded American Express card for spending, or use your SkyMiles account with a range of retail, hotel and travel services partners, including Apple, Nike, airbnb, Marriott and Hertz.'

  defaultMessage: 'SkyMiles is free to join and the newly enrolled start off as General Members. Above General Membership there are four “Elite” membership tiers.  Delta refers to members of its Elite SkyMiles levels  as “Medallion Members”.  Medallion Members get enhanced benefits, earn Miles at a higher rate and can rollover some Medallion Qualifying Miles (MQMs)  between membership years.'

aboutDeltaTextSeven: {
  id: 'pages.iberiaAirlines.aboutDeltaTextSeven',
  defaultMessage: 'What are MQMs? Well, as well as Miles, SkyMiles participants earn “Medallion Qualifying Miles” (MQMs).  These are the primary way Delta determines their“status” within the SkyMiles programme. The more MQMs a flier earns, the better chance they have of qualifying for the Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond tiers. However, it’s worth noting that Delta has made their loyalty scheme more complex than the equivalent schemes of most airlines based outside the US. '

aboutDeltaTextEight: {
  id: 'pages.iberiaAirlines.aboutDeltaTextEight',
  defaultMessage: 'Delta actually uses a combination of Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs), Medallion Qualification Segments (MQSs) and Medallion Qualification Dollars (MQDs), earned on Delta flights to determine Medallion Status. Then from time to time they offer Medallion Status Accelerators (MSAs) too which essentially help you climb the tiers faster.'

aboutDeltaTextNine: {
  id: 'pages.iberiaAirlines.aboutDeltaTextNine',
  defaultMessage: 'Despite the complexity, one thing is true across every SkyMiles tier. You can get great deals by redeeming your Miles for award flights. British airlines use the term “reward flights’, North American ones refer to “award flights”, they are essentially the same thing: Airline tickets you can book with loyalty points instead of paying the full cash price.'

aboutDeltaTextTen: {
  id: 'pages.iberiaAirlines.aboutDeltaTextTen',
  defaultMessage: 'Delta isn’t just interesting for SkyMiles members.  It is a founding member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance which also includes Air France, KLM, Alitalia, Korean Air, Air China, Aeroflot and AeroMexico. In 2012 Delta formed a joint venture with Virgin Atlantic, acquiring a 49% stake in the UK based airline. Whilst Virgin Atlantic isn’t officially a member of SkyTeam, the two airlines work closely together and members of their respective frequent flier programmes can earn and spend points across both carriers, along with many other reciprocal benefits. So SkyTeam members can earn Miles on Virgin Atlantic and with SkyTeam alliance airlines and vice versa. Thankfully most of these airlines have loyalty programmes which are less complicated too!'
